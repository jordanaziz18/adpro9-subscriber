### What is amqp?
- AMQP is an open standard protocol for message-oriented middleware, enabling reliable, secure, and platform-independent communication between clients and servers

### What does it mean? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first guest, and what is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for? 

- The first guest is the username. The second guest is the password. localhost is the hostname (the server where the AMQP broker, like RabbitMQ, is running). 5672 is the port number used by the AMQP protocol (the default port for RabbitMQ). So, the string connects to an AMQP server running in the local machine, using the username guest and password guest.
